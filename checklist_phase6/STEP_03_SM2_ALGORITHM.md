# Phase 6.3: SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm

## Objective
Implement the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm for intelligent card scheduling

## Prerequisites
- [x] Phase 6.1: Study Session Foundation completed
- [x] Phase 6.2: Answer Processing System completed

## Core Features

### 1. SM-2 Algorithm Implementation
- [x] **Core Algorithm Components**
  - [x] Quality rating processing (0-5 scale)
  - [x] Ease factor calculation (E-Factor)
  - [x] Repetition counter tracking
  - [x] Interval calculation
  - [x] Next review date scheduling

- [x] **Algorithm Logic**
  - [x] Initial E-Factor: 2.5
  - [x] Quality < 3: Reset repetition count
  - [x] Quality >= 3: Increase interval
  - [x] E-Factor adjustment based on quality
  - [x] Minimum interval: 1 day
  - [x] Minimum E-Factor: 1.3 (edge case protection)

### 2. Database Integration
- [x] **user_flashcard_progress Collection**
  - [x] ease_factor field (default: 2.5)
  - [x] interval field (default: 1)
  - [x] repetitions field (default: 0)
  - [x] next_review timestamp
  - [x] quality_history array
  - [x] last_studied timestamp
  - [x] times_studied counter
  - [x] first_studied timestamp

### 3. Review Mode Enhancement
- [x] **Due Cards Selection**
  - [x] Filter cards where next_review <= now
  - [x] Prioritize overdue cards
  - [x] Sort by urgency (days overdue)
  - [x] Limit to manageable batch size
  - [x] Due percentage calculation (66.7% in test)

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] **Answer Processing Hook**
  - [x] Update progress after each answer
  - [x] Recalculate scheduling parameters
  - [x] Store quality rating history
  - [x] Trigger next review calculation
  - [x] SM-2 data display in study sessions
